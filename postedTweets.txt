2025-03-27T07:14:23.850Z - Market's quiet but liquidity's thin. SUI's coiled—watch for a break above $1.20 to go long (12h hold). Funding slightly negative, shorts getting squeezed. Binance & KuCoin usually lag on pumps—buy there, flip on OKX. #SUI

Tontoken acting shaky, funding rates negative. Shorters loading up. Liquidity thin below $0.002—easy dump target. Quick 12hr play. Buy low on Binance, flip on Kucoin for 5-8% bounce. #tontoken ain't loyal, play it smart.*— KenyanMusk*

SUI's liquidity thin, funding slightly negative. If it holds $0.95, scalp long 6-12h. Binance & OKX got dips under $0.93—snag, flip for 3-5%. No panic, just levels. #SUI
2025-03-27T07:21:01.361Z - **$CRO looking shaky below $0.12—liquidity thin, funding rates neutral. Short with a 12h hold. Buy dips on Binance/Kucoin, flip at $0.125 for 4% scalp. Market’s sleepy, stay sharp. #CRO**  

*(Eldoret hustle taught me: no setups, no trades. This one’s clean.)*
